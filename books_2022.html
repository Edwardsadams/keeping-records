		Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West is a 1985 epic novel by American author Cormac McCarthy, classified under the Western, or sometimes the anti-Western, genre. McCarthy's fifth book, it was published by Random House. In a loosely historical context the narrative follows a fictional teenager referred to as "the kid," with the bulk of the text devoted to his experiences with the Glanton gang, a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred Indigenous Americans and others in the United States–Mexico borderlands from 1849 to 1850 for bounty, pleasure, and eventually out of nihilistic habit. The role of antagonist is gradually filled by Judge Holden, a physically massive, highly educated, preternaturally skilled member of the gang who is extremely pale and completely bald from head to toe.

		No Country for Old Men is a 2005 novel by American author Cormac McCarthy, who had originally written the story as a screenplay.[1] The story occurs in the vicinity of the Mexico–United States border in 1980 and concerns an illegal drug deal gone awry in the Texas desert back country. Owing to the novel's origins as a screenplay, the novel has a simple writing style different from other Cormac McCarthy novels. The book was adapted into the 2007 film No Country for Old Men, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

		The Crossing is a novel by American author Cormac McCarthy, published in 1994 by Alfred A. Knopf. The story is the second installment of McCarthy's "Border Trilogy". Like its predecessor, All the Pretty Horses (1992), The Crossing is a coming-of-age novel set on the border between the southwest United States and Mexico. The plot takes place before and during the Second World War and focuses on the life of the protagonist Billy Parham, a teenage cowboy; his family; and his younger brother Boyd. The story tells of three journeys taken from New Mexico to Mexico. It is noted for being a more melancholic novel than the first of the trilogy, without returning to the hellish bleakness of McCarthy's early novels. [1]

		All the Pretty Horses is a novel by American author Cormac McCarthy published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1992. Its romanticism, contrasting with the bleakness of Blood Meridian, McCarthy's earlier work, brought the writer much public attention. It was a bestseller, and it won both the U.S. National Book Award[1] and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It is also the first of McCarthy's "Border Trilogy". The book was adapted as a 2000 film starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz and directed by Billy Bob Thornton. The novel tells of John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old who grew up on his grandfather's ranch in San Angelo, Texas. The boy was raised for a significant part of his youth, perhaps 15 of his 16 years, by a family of Mexican origin who worked on the ranch; he is a native speaker of Spanish and English.[2] The story begins in 1949, soon after the death of John Grady's grandfather when Grady learns the ranch is to be sold. Faced with the prospect of moving into town, Grady instead chooses to leave and persuades his best friend, Lacey Rawlins, to accompany him. Traveling by horseback, the pair travel southward into Mexico, where they hope to find work as cowboys.

		Stella Maris is a 2022 novel by American writer Cormac McCarthy that was published on December 6th, 2022. It is a companion novel to The Passenger. The novel follows Alicia Western, a math prodigy conflicted by her father's contributions to the American development of the atomic bomb.[2] The entire novel is set in 1972 in Black River Falls, Wisconsin, at the titular Stella Maris, "a non-denominational facility and hospice for the care of psychiatric medical patients," as stated on page 1 (the only page that is not written in dialogue). The novel consists of a "series of conversations between Alicia and her psychiatrist, Dr. Cohen, written like a play but with no exposition, stage directions, or dialogue tags. The subjects include mathematics, quantum mechanics, music theory, and obscure philosophy."

	<p>
		The Gardener’s Son is a screenplay by American novelist Cormac McCarthy. It is the first published screenplay written by McCarthy. It is based around a strange murder in Graniteville, South Carolina in 1876 that is without many details. The story focuses on a young man embittered by the changes in his community due to the capitalist ways of the owner of the town's cotton mill. His anger grows until his rage consumes both himself and the families caught up in it. At the request of director Richard Pearce, McCarthy wrote the screenplay for a two-hour episode of the television series Visions that was broadcast by PBS on January 6, 1977. The episode was nominated for two Emmy awards and the screenplay has gone on to be published in book form.
